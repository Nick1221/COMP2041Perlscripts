14/9/15	  1:49	   2:40	   Coding	Changed Echo, and added ls. Not sure if i'm 						doing this correctly.
15/9/15   0:51	   2:48	   Coding/Debug	Fixed ls, added pwd, time and ls -l to the 						same condition. Fixed up echo to work with 						variables, seems like subset 0 is done. 					Passed autoruns for subset 0
16/9/15   1:29	   2:56	   Coding/Debug Seems to be breaking echo part when i 						started	subset 1, revised the code to work a 						bit better. Still feel like this is horribly 						hard coded but what can you do :^). 	
16/9/15   0:50	   2:01	   Coding/Debug	Wrote scripts to test subset0 and 1 though 						not working perfectly, fixed for, trying to 						use hashes for imports and doing cd. So far 						for and subset 0 works.
19/9/15   1:02     3:09	   Coding/Debug Changed echo variables case to work for most 						general cases(Till proven incorrect),finally 						done imports, completed subset 0 and subset 						1. Code seems to be not too messy, matching 						all the .py files in examples. (Except for 1 						extra newline in some files, minor stuff 						really)
20/9/15   22:49	   4:15    Coding/Debug Fixed a whole load of crap, some of it seems 						too hardcoded atm even though i tried 						accomodating for most common cases, done 						with subset 2 and working with subset 3. 						Seems tobe going well, but the code is still 						horrible (Many things to be done to tidy up 						the codes). 
21/9/15	  01:41	   4:02	   Coding/Debug Fixed more things, mainly in subset 2 and 3
					. Almost done with 4, just series left to 						match then it should be debugging and 						looking for more flags for specific things. 						Other than that, wrote files to run tests on 						subsets and that's about it.
22/9/15   11:30    2:03	   Coding/Debug Patched up subset 4, mainly fixing expr and 						$() and $(()), sorta confused about how that 						works, but atm it works fine with that. 					Series.sh left to do and also need to 						revisit old subsets and make sure the 						comments on spec is met.
23/9/15   23:20    4:42	   Coding/Debug Starting to look thourgh edge cases and breaking 						code. Need to really revisit things since these 					edge cases are absolutely wrecking all that work.
					Working through series, fixing positional params 						and conditional statements in while if and for.
