14/9/15	  1:49	   2:40	   Coding	Changed Echo, and added ls. Not sure if i'm 						doing this correctly.
15/9/15   0:51	   2:48	   Coding	Fixed ls, added pwd, time and ls -l to the 						same condition. Fixed up echo to work with 						variables, seems like subset 0 is done. 					Passed autoruns for subset 0
16/9/15   1:29	   2:56	   Coding/Debug Seems to be breaking echo part when i started 						subset 1, revised the code to work a bit 						better. Still feel like this is horribly hard 						coded but what can you do :^). 	
16/9/15   0:50	   2:01	   Coding/Degub	Wrote scripts to test subset0 and 1 though 						not working perfectly, fixed for, trying to 						use hashes for imports and doing cd. So far 						for and subset 0 works.
